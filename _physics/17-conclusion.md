Proper Space Kinematics offers a single geometric postulate---space densifies uniformly at rate c---from which it attempts to derive gravitation, cosmological structure, electromagnetic phenomena, thermodynamic behavior, nuclear binding, and quantum effects.

The framework reduces the four fundamental forces to one geometric process operating at different scales, plus a correction mechanism (the weak force as geometric shedding). It grounds the inverse square law, the arrow of time, the second law of thermodynamics, quantum measurement, and entanglement in the same geometric foundation.

PSK does not claim to supplant established physics. General relativity, quantum mechanics, and the Standard Model work. Their predictions are validated. PSK proposes an alternative interpretive substrate---a different picture of what might be happening beneath the mathematics.

Whether this picture is \"real\" may be undecidable. If PSK reproduces all observations identically to standard frameworks, the choice between them becomes philosophical rather than empirical. But if PSK makes distinct predictions---about neutrino flux, galactic rotation, cosmic acceleration, local recession---then observation can adjudicate.

The value of PSK, if any, lies not in being correct but in being clarifying. If viewing familiar phenomena through the lens of spatial densification illuminates connections otherwise obscured---between gravity and the strong force, between quantum measurement and heat flow, between the arrow of time and the structure of the cosmos---then the framework has served its purpose.

The universe, as PSK depicts it, began as unity---all matter contiguous in infinitely sparse space. Through densification, voids emerged, structure formed, and the cosmos we observe came into being. It will end in isolation---each bound structure alone within its horizon as densification carries everything else away. From unity through structure to solitude, all from one process at one rate.

Whether this is true, we cannot say. But it is a picture worth considering.
