summary: Motivation and overview of the Proper Space Kinematics framework.
---

The standard model of gravity, rooted in Einstein's General Relativity, describes gravitational 
phenomena as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. While extraordinarily 
successful in its predictions, this framework presents conceptual challenges that have 
motivated the search for alternative interpretations.

## Motivation

This work proposes an alternative framework—**Proper Space Kinematics**—which reinterprets 
gravitational effects not as curvature of a four-dimensional spacetime manifold, but as 
gradients in the density of three-dimensional space itself.

## Key Premises

1. **Spatial Density**: Space possesses a measurable density that varies with proximity to mass
2. **Gradient Effects**: What we perceive as gravitational attraction emerges from spatial density gradients
3. **Time as Emergent**: Temporal effects arise from the interaction of objects with varying spatial densities

## Document Status

This document represents a work in progress. Revisions are published as the framework develops.
