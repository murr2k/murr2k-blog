summary: Mathematical formulation of spatial density and its relationship to mass.
---

In the Proper Space Kinematics framework, the fundamental quantity is not the metric tensor 
of spacetime, but rather a scalar field representing the density of space itself.

## Definition of Spatial Density

We define spatial density ρ_s as a scalar field that quantifies the "amount of space" per 
unit coordinate volume. Near massive objects, spatial density increases—space becomes 
"denser" or more "concentrated."

## Relationship to Mass

The spatial density field is sourced by mass according to:

```
∇²ρ_s = κM
```

where κ is a coupling constant relating mass to spatial density perturbation.

## Observable Consequences

This formulation predicts identical observational signatures to General Relativity for:
- Gravitational redshift
- Light deflection
- Orbital precession

The distinction lies in interpretation, not prediction.

## Next Steps

Chapter 3 will develop the equations of motion for test particles in a spatial density gradient.
