The Standard View

Standard physics defines the Planck scale---Planck length (\~10⁻³⁵ m), Planck time (\~10⁻⁴³ s), Planck mass (\~10⁻⁸ kg)---as fundamental limits where quantum gravitational effects dominate. Below these scales, spacetime is thought to become discrete, foamy, or otherwise non-classical. The Planck scale represents the boundary of classical spacetime.

The PSK Position

PSK rejects the Planck scale as fundamental. There is no minimum length, no minimum time, no discretization of space.

Spatial densification is an infinitesimally continuous process. Space and matter have traversed through every density state from the infinite past to the present, passing through ρ → 0 and every value since. There are no jumps, no gaps, no quantization of the substrate.

Entropy increases continuously, not in discrete steps. The second law of thermodynamics in PSK is a consequence of continuous densification, not statistical mechanics over discrete configurations.

Implications

This position is incompatible with approaches that quantize spacetime, such as loop quantum gravity. PSK suggests that the apparent need for quantization arises from attempting to merge two frameworks (GR and QM) that PSK reinterprets as manifestations of a single continuous geometric process.

The singularities that plague general relativity (black holes, Big Bang) are not resolved by quantization in PSK. They are dissolved by reinterpreting what those solutions describe: not infinite density of matter, but limits of spatial density evolution that PSK frames differently.

PSK is committed to genuine mathematical continuum---not \"continuous until you look closely enough\" but continuous at every scale, without limit.
